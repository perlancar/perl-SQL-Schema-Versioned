0.04    2013-03-14 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Put creating 'meta' table inside transaction, so if 'install' phase
          fails, the meta table is not created (at least on Postgres which has
          transactional DDL).


0.03    2013-03-01 (SHARYANTO)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Change 'sqls' argument (an array of SQL statement strings) to 'spec'
          (a hash of series of SQL statement strings). This is so that we can
          have/see 'install' which is the SQL statements for the latest version.
